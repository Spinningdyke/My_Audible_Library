window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> bestseller (<i>The Biggest Buff</i>, <i>The Confidence Game</i>, <i>Mastermind</i>) and <i>New Yorker</i> writer Maria Konnikova delves into the mysterious ailment that she and 39 million others suffer from in the U.S. alone: Migraine, a disease that is still little understood, yet debilitating to its sufferers. Konnikova takes a clear-eyed look at migraine’s history, diving into current theories and more recent approaches - and offers a deeply personal account of what it’s like to experience migraine, usually with little warning and always to a level that is devastating to a degree.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eighteen percent of women are thought to suffer from migraine, and Konnikova thinks that it’s not a coincidence that the ailment has not gotten the medical investigation that it deserves. It is unfortunately far too common to see medical data gaps where a predominantly female patient population is concerned.</p> <p>Informative and entertaining, <i>Migraine </i>is an Audible Original for those who suffer from migraine and those with sufferers in their lives - which would amount to just about everyone.</p>";
