window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A powerful and revealing story about Georgia O’Keeffe, torn between the city that made her and the desert that promises to set her free, written by Paula McLain, the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Paris Wife </i>and the forthcoming <i>When the Stars Go Dark</i>, and performed by Emmy Award-winning actress Cynthia Nixon.</p> <p>It’s 1929 in New York City. In an apartment high above Lexington Avenue, the painter Georgia O’Keeffe feels stuck. At 42, she should be at the apex of her powers as an artist, and yet something is missing. Her husband - the gallerist Alfred Stieglitz, who helped build her reputation in the art world - has grown needy and insecure, not to mention unfaithful. More than this, her work has lost its fire, and she knows it. The calla lilies and poppies for which she is revered now seem careful, predictable. Feeling desperate and conflicted, Georgia flees to New Mexico in search of something that will ignite her once again. There, she meets an adventurous young woman whose energy and optimism take hold of Georgia and show her a glimpse of what another kind of life - one of her own making - might look like.</p> <p>Set against the transcendent desert landscapes of New Mexico, and brought to life by a beloved voice and contemporary master of historical fiction, <i>Something That Cannot Die </i>is an intimate portrait of a great artist and the adventures - both physical and spiritual - that moved and changed her.</p>";
