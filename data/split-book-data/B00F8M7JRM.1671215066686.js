window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this clever and quirky follow-up to <i>The Gates</i> and <i>The Infernals</i>, Samuel Johnson's life seems to have finally settled down - after all, he's still got the company of his faithful dachshund Boswell and his bumbling demon friend Nurd; he has foiled the dreaded forces of darkness not once but twice; and he's now dating the lovely Lucy Highmore. </p> <p>But things in the little English town of Biddlecombe rarely run smoothly for long. Shadows are gathering in the skies; a black heart of pure evil is bubbling with revenge; and it rather looks as if the Multiverse is about to come to an end, starting with Biddlecombe. When a new toy shop's opening goes terrifyingly awry, Samuel must gather a ragtag band of dwarfs, policemen, and very polite monsters to face down the greatest threat the Multiverse has ever known, not to mention assorted vampires, a girl with an unnatural fondness for spiders, and highly flammable unfriendly elves.</p> <p>The latest installment of John Connolly's wholly original and creepily imaginative Samuel Johnson Tales, <i>The Creeps</i> is humorous horror for anyone who enjoys fiction at its best.</p>";
