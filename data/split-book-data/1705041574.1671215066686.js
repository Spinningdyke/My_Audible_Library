window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the incomparable Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Award winner, a powerful and revealing autobiography about race, sexuality, and art.</b></p> <p>It’s easy to be yourself when who and what you are is in vogue. But growing up Black and gay in America has never been easy. Before Billy Porter was slaying red carpets and giving an iconic performance in the celebrated TV show <i>Pose</i>; before he was the Tony Award-winning star of Broadway’s<i> Kinky Boots</i>; and before he was an acclaimed recording artist, actor, playwright, and all-around diva, Porter was a young boy who didn’t fit in. At five years old he was sent to therapy to fix his effeminacy. He was endlessly bullied at school, sexually abused by his stepfather, and came of age in a world where simply being himself was a constant struggle.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Unprotected </i>is the story of a singular artist in his own words. It is the story of a boy whose talent, courage, and desperate determination led him through countless hard times to where he is now; an icon whose refusal to back down in the face of adversity has made him an inspiration to millions. Porter is a multitalented, multifaceted treasure at the top of his game. A soaring, resonant story, full of new revelations, and shot through with his stunning wit, <i>Unprotected </i>will entertain and inspire.</p>";
