Given only a few words in Homer’s epic and largely erased by history, she is nonetheless a pivotal figure in the Trojan War.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this audiobook she comes fully to life: wry, watchful, forging connections among her fellow female prisoners even as she is caught between Greece’s two most powerful warriors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her story pulls back the veil on the thousands of women who lived behind the scenes of the Greek army camp - concubines, nurses, prostitutes, the women who lay out the dead - as gods and mortals spar, and as a legendary war hurtles toward its inevitable conclusion.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brilliantly written, filled with moments of terror and beauty,<i> The Silence of the Girls</i> gives voice to an extraordinary woman - and makes an ancient story new again.&nbsp;</p>";
